[Stitz-Zeager's Precalculus](https://stitz-zeager.com/), the excellent
mathematics book, formatted for A6 paper that can be read on small screen
devices. I am using a Kindle 6" with the PDF loaded using
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/donate).

You can find the latest build from the [pdf-output
branch](https://github.com/arunkd13/precalculus/tree/pdf-output).
